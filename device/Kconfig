config DEVICE_ID

    help
        The device id that identifies the specific UHK half or dongle.

config KEYBOARD_MAX_SCANCODE
    hex "highest keyboard scancode"
    default 0x86
    range 0x66 0xDD
    help
        The highest keyboard scancode value influences the overall length of the HID record sent to the host.
        The default is set so Android devices (which don't exchange the MTU from the default 23)
        still receive the "NKRO" report layout. If a higher scancode is used, the report size will exceed this size,
        causing a fallback to 6KRO report layout on Android.

config USB_PID
    hex "USB product ID"
    range 0x0000 0xFFFF
    help
        The USB product ID is used to identify the specific UHK device.
